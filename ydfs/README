Building ydfs
-------------

ydfs can be compiled and used on Linux
We support big endian and little endian architectures,32bit or 64bit.

It is as simple as:
	% make
	% make install
	% make clean
NOTE:	--prefix= is supported

Running ydfs
------------

To run ydfs with the default configuration just type:
	% cd storage
	./ydfs_storage
Another terminal or computer
	% cd trakcer
	./ydfs_tracker
Another terminal or computer
	% cd client 
	%./ydfs_client uploadTest [which dir] [file_num] [thread_pool_size]
	%./ydfs_client download [file_num] [thread_pool_size]


Testint ydfs
------------

After complied, you may type:
	% make double_test_storage
Then you will find storage and storage.config in storage/1
		and storage and storage.config in storage/2
One terminal
	%cd storage/1
	./ydfs_storage
Another terminal
	%cd storage/2
	./ydfs_storage
Another terminal
	%cd tracker
	./ydfs_tracker
Another terminal
	%cd client
	%./ydfs_client uploadTest [which dir] [file_num] [thread_pool_size]
	%./ydfs_client download [file_num] [thread_pool_size]

NOTE:	this client is written for test.
	DO NOT RUN IT AT ONLINE ENVIRONMENT!

Recovery storage of ydfs
------------------------
if storage has broken down,you want to recovery it
then 
	vim storage.config
you will find "storage_id = -1"
modify "-1" as storage_id of the tracker shown
then
	./ydfs_storage
